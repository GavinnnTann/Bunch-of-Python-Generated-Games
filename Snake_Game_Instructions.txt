# Snake Game Instructions

Welcome to the Snake Game! This classic game has been enhanced with pathfinding algorithms.

## Game Modes

1. **Manual Play**
   - Control the snake using the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)
   - Navigate to eat the red food dots while avoiding walls, obstacles, and your own tail

2. **A* Algorithm Mode**
   - Watch the A* algorithm control the snake automatically
   - The A* algorithm seeks the shortest path to food using a heuristic (Manhattan distance)
   - It's optimized to prefer direct paths to the food

3. **Dijkstra Algorithm Mode**
   - Watch Dijkstra's algorithm control the snake automatically
   - Dijkstra's algorithm explores all possible paths based on distance from the start
   - It performs a more exhaustive search compared to A*

## Game Elements

- **Green Segments**: The snake (bright green head, light green body)
- **Red Circles**: Food (increases your score and snake length)
- **Gray Squares**: Obstacles (avoid these)
- **Black Background**: The game area

## Rules

- Score increases by 10 points each time the snake eats food
- Every 50 points, you level up:
  - The snake moves faster
  - More obstacles appear
- Game ends if the snake:
  - Hits a wall (edge of the screen)
  - Collides with its own body
  - Runs into an obstacle

## Algorithm Details

### A* Algorithm
- Uses a heuristic function (Manhattan distance) to guide search toward the food
- Balances the known distance from the start with the estimated distance to the goal
- Generally finds the shortest path using fewer computations
- Will try to follow its tail if no path to food is available

### Dijkstra's Algorithm  
- Explores all possible paths based on distance from the start
- Doesn't use a heuristic, so it searches in "waves" from the starting point
- Guaranteed to find the shortest path if one exists
- Often explores more of the board than A* before finding a solution

## Controls

- **Arrow Keys**: Change direction (Manual mode)
- **R**: Restart the game after Game Over
- The algorithm modes play automatically

## Tips

- Plan your moves ahead in manual mode
- Watch how the algorithms navigate around obstacles
- Notice the different search patterns between A* and Dijkstra
- The game gets progressively more challenging with each level

Enjoy playing and learning about pathfinding algorithms!
